#+title: Episteme

Episteme is a social knowledge-basing system for Emacs.

Knowledge-bases are comprised of files written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode]] (kinda-sorta
markdown-like, but way better).

Episteme consists of [[./support.org][emacs customizations]] that make it easy to navigate and
contribute to knowledge-bases.

You can create your own knowledge-base, browse community knowledge-bases, or
collaborate on them together.
