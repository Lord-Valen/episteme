#+title: Episteme

Apoptosis' community knowledge-base built ontop a customized Emacs.

The knowledge-base is comprised of [[./org][organized files]], written in [[https://orgmode.org/][Org-mode.]]

Our [[./support.org][emacs customization]] provides a number of features for navigating and
contributing to the knowledge-base. It also provides sleek modern experience:

* Installing

You must have the following globally available:

- Emacs
- Git

Start by cloning Episteme somewhere:

#+begin_src sh
  git clone https://github.com/apoptosis/episteme.git ~/episteme
#+end_src

** Linux

Just run =episteme=:

#+begin_src sh
  ./episteme -h
#+end_src

** NixOS

Install =episteme=:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -i -f .
#+end_src

Then run:

#+begin_src sh
  episteme -h
#+end_src

*** Epi helper

A small helper =epi= is provided to bake in the =-repo= flag.

Edit =epi.nix= to adjust the =-repo= flag to point to the Episteme repo on your
machine. Then install it:

#+begin_src sh
  nix-env -i -f epi.nix
#+end_src

** Windows

The following will be installed via [[https://chocolatey.org/][Chocolatey]]:

- Emacs
- Git
- Github for Windows
- Sharpkeys (optional)


*** Installing Chocolatey

Chocolatey is a system for installing software on Windows.

Follow these instructions:

1. Type "powershell" into Start Menu
2. Open PowerShell _as Administrator_.
3. In PowerShell terminal, type (followed by enter):
   =Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))=
4. In PowerShell terminal, type (followed by enter):
   =choco -?=

If the last command succeeded you're ready to move on.

*** Installing Dependencies

Use =choco= command to install the necessary software:

#+begin_src sh
  choco install git github emacs sharpkeys
#+end_src

*** Installing Episteme

Open =GitHub for Windows= using the Start Menu.

Follow the prompts, and use "offline account".

Clone a repository, and use the following URL:

https://github.com/apoptosis/episteme.git

This will put Episteme at =%USERPROFILE%\Documents\GitHub\episteme=

*** Running Episteme

Open =Git-Bash= using the Start Menu.

Then type the following:

#+begin_src sh
  cd $USERPROFILE/Documents/GitHub/episteme
  ./episteme
#+end_src

*** Installing fonts

Once Episteme is running some fonts might be missing.

Use =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= and pick a location to download the fonts.

Afterwards, open each downloaded font file, and install it. Restart Episteme
and the fonts should be working.
* Running Episteme

Use the =-h= flag to explore the =episteme= cli:

#+begin_src
  episteme [EPISTEME-OPTS] [EMACS-OPTS]

    EPISTEME-OPTS:
      -h             list usage
      -repo          Episteme repo (default: $PWD)
      -themes        print theme names & exit
      -theme NAME    use theme called NAME

    EMACS-OPTS:
      typical Emacs options
#+end_src

** -repo

Use this to specify the location of the Episteme git repo.

If you run =episteme= from inside the repo, this flag is not necessary.

** -config

Use this to specify the location of the Episteme config directory.

This is the directory where =config.el= should be placed.

The default is =$HOME/.config/episteme=

** -themes

List the available themes.

** -theme

Specify the name of theme to use.

** Emacs Options

Any additional options will be passed to emacs.

* Configuration

Edit =config.el= within the Episteme configuration directory to customize
options.

** Setting options

Options are set with the =setq= function:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (setq variable-name "variable value")
#+end_src

** Keybindings

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  ;; keybind for the main menu
  (setq episteme/main-menu-key "C-c x")

  ;; keybind for the mode menu
  (setq episteme/mode-menu-key "C-c m")
#+end_src

** Additional Configuration

Your =config.el= may contain any additional emacs configuration.

* Main Menu

Activate the main menu with the keybind assigned to =episteme/main-menu-key= (=C-c
x= by default).

The spacebar will return to previous menus.

The main menu offers a few options for navigating Episteme:

** =o=: open
Walk directories and files until reaching the desired content.

Use =enter= to navigate.

Use =C-enter= to visit the currently selected item.

** =g=: github

Open the git interface.

As you make changes to Episteme you'll use git to submit your changes.

** =h=: help

Access a comprehensive menu.

** =m=: mark

Manipulate the document mark.

** =w=: windows

Manage the emacs windows.

** =z=: zoom

Adjust the zoom per-buffer or globally.

** =r=: registers

Maniplate the emacs registers.

** =;=: embrace

Convert between balanced parenthesis types. (e.g. (foo) => [foo], etc.)

* Mode Menus

Activate the mode menu for the current buffer mode, if there is one, with the
keybind assigned to =episteme/mode-menu-key= (=C-c m= by default).

The spacebar will return to previous menus.

Modes which currently feature a menu:

- =emacs-lisp-mode=
- =org-mode=

Each mode menu is different, so explore!
