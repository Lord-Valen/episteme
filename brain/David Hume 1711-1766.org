#+BRAIN_PARENTS: The%20Enlightenment

* Epistemology
- Ideas are copies of our sense impressions
- Three relations among ideas:
  - Resemblance
  - Spatio-temporal
  - Cause-effect
- Reason alone cannot justify our belief in experience
- Belief in our experiences as representing the external world accurately is
  based on our instinct or custom, and cannot be proven with reason.
* Morality
- Scientific theory of morality
- Moral judgement cannot be based on rational deliberation, because simpletons
  and infants are also capable of making moral judgements.
- There is no evidence that indicates that the most intellectually capable
  members of our species are the most moral.
- Therefore, our sense of morality is based in part on our biology and in part
  by our social context.
- We have a natural appreciation of virtuous behavior, and are thus naturally
  moral at least in part.
- You cannot deterministically go from "is" to an "ought"
** What makes a moral rule universal?
- Primarily, its utility
- All government and political institutions have their basis in utility to
  society.
* Religion
- Basing religious belief on inference from experience has four flaws:
  - It means that religion is probable at best, becasue all ideas are derived
    from experience, not reason.
  - In all scientific inquiries, negative evidence counts more than positive
    evidence. So we would require positive evidence with zero negative evidence
    in order to justify our belief in god through experience.
