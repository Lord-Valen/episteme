#+BRAIN_PARENTS: Philosophy

- Was aware of the dangers and problems that could arise from too much
  specialization of labout and the social isolation that could result.
- Worried about the moral impact on someone who shifted from a village-centric
  social context to that of a large city and the anonymity that could result.
- Also concered about class and wealth disparity and impacts that would have on
  society.

* The Wealth of Nations: The Division of Labour
- Specialization of job function leads to massive gains in efficiency.
- Coordination and cooperation between specialists is done out of self-interest.
- We get what we need from others out of their self-interest, not their
  charity.
* The Theory of Moral Sentiment
- Offers an explanation and basis for the cooperation and coordination that are
  required for the division of labout described in Wealth of Nations.
**  Why?
- We want the approval of others.
- The reactions of others to us and our behaviors is important to us.
- We generally seek to behave as if there were an impartial spectator observing
  our behaviours. Would they approve of them?
- Our conscience is a product of these factors.
** Obeying the Law
We do so because of the utility of doing so. In genera, we derive benefit when
we do so.
