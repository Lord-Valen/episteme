* Remotes

Remotes allow for juggling multiple knowledge-bases.

Remotes are stored as directories under =~.config/episteme/remotes/=

** Data Spec

Each remote has the following properties:

- =name= : used for the path under =remotes/= and displaying to the user
- =url=  : nil or the git url for the remote
