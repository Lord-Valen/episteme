** ChanServ

All ChanServ commands begin with =/cs= or =/chanserv= or =/msg ChanServ=. Depending
on your client and network, =/cs= or =/chanserv= may not work. I will use the
shorthand in these examples.

| command                                    | description                                                                               |
|--------------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

| /cs register #channel password description | Registers the current channel to you with ChanServ and sets its password and description. |
| /cs drop #channel [dropcode]               | Un-registers the current channel to you with ChanServ.                                    |
