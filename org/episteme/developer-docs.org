** Utility Libraries
A number of utility libraries are made available in =support.org=.

These libraries can help keep the lisp style modern and clean. Take a look over
them and try to use them where applicable.

- [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/cl.html][cl-lib]] emulates a number of common-lisp facilties (like EIEIO)
- [[https://github.com/rejeep/f.el][f.el]] for working with files
- [[https://github.com/magnars/dash.el][dash.el]] for working with lists
- [[https://github.com/Wilfred/ht.el][ht.el]] for working with hash tables
- [[https://github.com/magnars/s.el][s.el]] for working with strings
- [[https://github.com/plexus/a.el][a.el]] for working with association lists
- [[https://github.com/rolandwalker/anaphora][anaphora.el]] for anaphora support


* Architecture
There are three major pieces to Episteme:

- The =episteme= cli
- The =support.org= file
- The knowledge-base in =org/=
- The config directory at =$HOME/.config/episteme=

Episteme's boot process is something like:

1. cli commandline-arguments
2. runs emacs
3. compiles =support.org= to =support.el=
4. loads =support.el=
   - calculate global =episteme/*= variables
   - load user configuration
   - install straight.el support (package manager)
   - install and configure a number of packages
   - open the dashboard

** The Repo
The user must have the Episteme git repo cloned somewhere on their machine. The
repo contains the current knowledge-base, =support.org= and the =episteme= cli.

The repository is the mechanism to push/receive updates.

The =episteme= cli option =-repo= option will set the =$repo= environment-variable
that controls =support.org=.

** The Config directory
The config directory contains:
- installed emacs packages
- the user's =config.el=

By default it is located at =$HOME/.config/episteme/=

The =episteme= cli option =-config= will set the =$config= environment-variable that
controls =support.org=.

** Environment Variables

Two primary environment variables are of interest:

- =$repo= where the git checkout of episteme is located
- =$config= where the emacs and user configuration is located

Other variables will be computed from these two.

** Emacs Variables

The following variables are used throughout =support.org=

These may be set from =config.el=

- =episteme/repo= the location of the Episteme git repo
- =episteme/home= the episteme config directory
- =episteme/config= the absolute path to user's =config.el=
- =episteme/org= the location of the knowledge-base files
- =episteme/autosaves= where autosaves should be stored
- =episteme/backsups= where backups should be stored
- =episteme/main-menu-key= key to open the main menu
- =episteme/mode-menu-key= key to open the mode menu
- =episteme/zoom= the default zoom level
